There is an irregular junctional melanocytic proliferation with moderate atypia associated with a benign dermal nevus component. In this biopsy sample, the features are still in keeping with an atypical nevus and are insufficient for melanoma. However, if this is a ""new"" or changing lesion, there is concern the junctional melanocytic proliferation may progress (i.e. represent an evolving ""dysplasia""). Conservative complete removal is desirable, but careful follow-up of this site with a low threshold for re-biopsy would also be a reasonable course of action.         "

The findings are worrisome for a regressed melanocytic proliferation, particularly of a melanoma (which would be no thicker than 0.2 mm), however, given the small sample it is difficult to unequivocally make the diagnosis.

There is associated inflammation and hyperpigmentation of epidermal keratinocytes at all layers of the epidermis.   Note: Levels and immunsotains for MITF and melan-A were examined. The histopathologic findings are not entirely straightforward and subject to interobserver variability. I favor an irritated and inflamed evolving nevus with features of a pigmented spindle cell nevus.

There is associated atypical epidermal hyperplasia with a band-like infiltrate of lymphocytes and histiocytes. The findings are worrisome for a regressed melanocytic proliferation, particularly of a melanoma (which would be no thicker than 0.2 mm), however, given the small sample it is difficult to unequivocally make the diagnosis. Review of the excision will be needed to better characterize the lesion, which extends to the sides and base.

Skin, right forearm, shave biopsy / removal:    - Atypical intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation associated with a compound melanocytic nevus (see Note.)   Note: At this point one may still classify the lesion as a lentiginous compound melanocytic nevus with moderate atypia and unusual features of its junctional component. The unusual features include a fairly broad shoulder, scattered solitary units of atypical junctional melanocytes, and macro-melanosomes. The findings were reviewed with my colleagues Drs. Pulitzer and Hollmann. While nobody was willing to interpret the findings as melanoma, we are concerned about an evolving junctional melanocytic dysplasia with potential to progress to melanoma. The atypical junctional melanocytic proliferation focally extends to within < 1.5 mm of a side margin. As far as clinical care, a re-excision merits consideration to assure complete removal and minimize risk for recurrence or progression. However, one may follow this site clinically with a low threshold for re-biopsy if a change is noted.   "

There is slight overlying epidermal hyperplasia, features of trauma including superficial fibrosing granulation tissue, slight junctional melanocyte hyperplasia, and slightly increased dermal collagen bundles. The findings are most in keeping with a paucicellular dermatofibroma, which has been traumatized. PAS-D is negative for fungal forms.

Colocalization of A103 with Ki67 is not seen; mitotic figures are not identified. BAP1 labeling is retained.

The melanocyte density is much less than in part 1, but focally increased to a level worrisome for a subtle early stage in the evolving of a lentiginous junctional melanocyte dysplasia. Given the predominance of solitary units of melanocytes and background of solar lentigo, I do not think that this is the picture of an evolving dysplastic nevus. It is more likely an ""atypical lentigo"", which may progress to a lentigo maligna. The inked section margins are not involved. The clearance from the section edge is approximately 1 mm. Clinical correlation is advised. If there is a  residual clinical lesion, its complete removal is advised. If there is no residual clinical lesion, given the subtlety of the findings, one may consider a ""conservative"" approach (topical treatment and/or clinical follow-up) with a low threshold for re-biopsy if and when a change is noted.

Note:  There are borderline features between severely atypical and inflamed nevus and evolving radial growth phase melanoma.  Based on the presence of significant dermal melanocytic atypia within nests showing mib-1 reactivity in the A103+ population, we favor management as melanoma, invasive to a depth of approximately 0.32 mm, nonmitogenic and negative for ulceration. P16 reactivity is variable.  Additional margin is needed (margins are close).  This case was reviewed at the MSKCC dermatopathology staff consensus conference on 3/26/15 with agreement.   "
