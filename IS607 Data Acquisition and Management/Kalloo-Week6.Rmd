data3 = data3 %>% mutate(percent_delayed = 100*delayed/(`on time` + delayed))
data3 %>% kable()


data3 %>% group_by(city) %>% summarise(total_delayed   = sum(delayed),
                                       total_on_time   = sum(`on time`),
                                       percent_delayed = 100*total_delayed/(total_delayed+total_on_time)) %>% kable()

data3 %>% group_by(Airline) %>% summarise(total_delayed   = sum(delayed),
                                          total_on_time   = sum(`on time`),
                                          percent_delayed = 100*total_delayed/(total_delayed+total_on_time)) %>% kable()

```
        
It can be seen that San Francisco and Seattle have the greatest percentage of delayed flights, with Alaska Airlines being generally more delayed than AM WEST.
